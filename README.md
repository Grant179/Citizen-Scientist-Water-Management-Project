# Citizen-Scientist-Water-Management-Project

Measuring the Quality and Quantity of water and use LoRaWAN protocol to see real time data and make predictions on flood warning.

The Aim of this exercise is to get familiarize with the water control and management sensors and how anyone can receive and visualize the data in real time.


Monitoring of water quality and quantity is essential in efficient management of the surface and ground water resources to maximize reliability for users in an efficient, effective, safe and financially responsible manner. To monitor these resources, one requires large amount of information and data. The monitoring involves a combination of automatic digital sensors and logging devices as well as manual sampling and analysis.
