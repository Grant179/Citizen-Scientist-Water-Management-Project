Measuring the Quality and Quantity of water using the LoRaWAN protocol to see real time data and make predictions on flood warning.

The aim of this exercise is to get familiar with the water control and management sensors and discover how anyone can receive and visualise the data in real time.

Monitoring of water quality and quantity is essential in the management of the surface and ground water resources. It is important to manage these resources in a reliable, efficient, effective, safe and financially responsible manner. To monitor these resources, one requires a large amount of information and data. The monitoring involves a combination of automatic digital sensors and logging devices as well as manual sampling and analysis.

This Tutorial consists of three stages of learning as mentioned below
1. Basic introduction to software and hardware
2. Introduction to sensors
3. Internet of things

The first stage will give you fundamental knowledge of the hardware and software. The second stage is the introduction of three sensors, that you will find in your kit namely; Temperature, Ultrasonic and Turbidity sensor. The third and last step will give you fundamental knowledge of the Internet of Things, and explain how anyone can connect any sensor with internet.
